# FingerPrint-liveness-Detection
This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to detect the liveness of fingerprints â€” distinguishing between real, live fingerprints and spoofed or fake ones (like from silicone, gelatin, or printed images). It's a deep learning-based biometric security system that ensures authentication is based on actual human presence, not just pattern mimicry.
